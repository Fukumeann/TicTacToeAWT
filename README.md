To run the Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java using AWT, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Instructions:

1. **Compile the Code:**
   - Save the provided code into a file named `TicTacToeAWT.java`.
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `TicTacToeAWT.java` is saved.
   - Compile the code using the following command:
     ```
     javac TicTacToeAWT.java
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - After successful compilation, run the program using:
     ```
     java Main
     ```
   - This command executes the `Main` class, which in turn initializes the `TicTacToeAWT` game.

3. **Play the Game:**
   - The game window titled "Tic-Tac-Toe" should appear.
   - You can play the game by clicking on the game buttons to place X or O.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions for game status (e.g., whose turn it is, who wins).

4. **Restart or Reset:**
   - Use the "Restart" button to restart the game with the same scoreboard.
   - Use the "Reset" button to reset the scoreboard to zero for both X and O scores.

5. **Closing the Game:**
   - Close the game window to exit the program.

### Notes:
- Ensure your Java environment (`javac` and `java` commands) is properly configured.
- The game uses AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) for the graphical interface.
- The scoreboard tracks wins for both X and O players until manually reset.

By following these steps, you should be able to compile, run, and enjoy playing the Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java with AWT.
